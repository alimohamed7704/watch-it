# 🎬 Watch It

This project is a **Java-based clone of the real streaming website "Watch It"**. Built entirely in **Java** with a **JavaFX GUI**, it demonstrates full **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles while allowing users to explore, rate, and manage movies and TV shows in a visually interactive interface.  

## 🚀 Features

- **Full OOP Design**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction are fully utilized to structure the system.  
- **Dynamic Search with DP**: Efficient searching of movies and TV shows using **dynamic programming** for fast lookups.  
- **User Accounts**: Users can create accounts, rate movies and TV shows, and maintain a personalized watchlist.  
- **Regex Validation**: Login and sign-up forms use **regular expressions (regex)** to ensure valid input for usernames, emails, and passwords.  
- **Admin Panel**: Admin login provides complete control—**add, update, or remove** movies and shows from the library.  
- **JavaFX GUI**: Modern graphical interface for smooth and interactive user experience.  
- **Detailed Information**: Access cast, synopsis, and ratings for each movie or TV show.
